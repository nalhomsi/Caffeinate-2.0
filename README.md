# Caffeinate-2.0

Tired of Starbucks? Want to explore the culture of your city? Caffeinate the City lists the location and reviews of the local coffee shops in Austin so that you can expand your coffee horizons. By clicking on an icon near your neighborhood, Caffeinate will list shops in your area so that you can find your new favorite spot! Users can log in and rate their coffee shops, as well as leave feedback and reviews. 

The motivation of this project is to push local businesses, especially in the time of covid when local businesses are struggling. They may not have the revenue for advertisement the way a corporate coffee chain would so our app draws attention to them.
